## Project Context

We are currently studying Front End Developement at the Turing School of Software and Design. This app is the product of our Mod 3 group project, assigned and completed approximately four months into our coding careers. The purpose of this project was to be a "stretch tech": implementing a technology (TypeScript) in the app that was self-taught over the duration of the project.

Requirements for this project included:

- Meeting the specs for an “MVP” listed in the Project Spec
- Using at least one external API
- Implementing one of the “Stretch Technologies” listed in the Project Spec
- The app being deployed
