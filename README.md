# [Soupwarts](https://scottdgaines.github.io/soupwarts/#/)

## Overview
The students of Hogwarts are hungry, and they want soup. But alas! a Hufflepuff can't be caught eating a soup typed as Slytherin! Fear no more, wunderkids: Soupwarts is here to help. Upon selecting their house, users are generated a randomized soup recipe categorized accordingly to their house. Users can navigate to different houses from their soup recipe's page (if they would like to see what their classmates are eating), and users can return to the main page once they are done.

## Project Context

We are currently studying Front End Developement at the Turing School of Software and Design. This app is the product of our Mod 3 group project, assigned and completed approximately four months into our coding careers. The purpose of this project was to be a "stretch tech": implementing a technology (TypeScript) in the app that was self-taught in the course of the project.

Requirements for this project included:

- Meeting the specs for an “MVP” listed in the Project Spec
- Using at least one external API
- Implementing one of the “Stretch Technologies” listed in the Project Spec
- The app being deployed
