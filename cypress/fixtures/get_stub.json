        "instructions": "1. In a large, flameproof casserole over medium heat, heat oil. Saute onions in oil over medium heat until soft, about 5 minutes. 2. Break up tomatoes into small pieces. Stir together tomatoes and their juice, wine, tomato paste, brown sugar, currants, bay leaves, cinnamon, cumin, and cloves; add to casserole. 3. Add beef and simmer, covered, about 2 hours, or until meat is fork-tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and adjust other seasonings to taste. If stew is too liquid, uncover pan the last 30 minutes of cooking so that excess liquid will evaporate. 4. To serve immediately: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove casserole from heat and scatter cheese and nuts over top. Bake at 350 degrees F until cheese melts (about 5 minutes). * Timesaver Tip: Stew can be made up to 2 days ahead.
